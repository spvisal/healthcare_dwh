# 📊 Case Study: Data Warehouse Optimization and Compliance

## 1. 🚀 Scaling and Performance Management

- 🧩 **Partitioning of Fact Tables**  
  Improve query performance and manage large datasets efficiently.

- 📉 **Introduce Aggregated Fact Tables**  
  Pre-compute and store aggregated data to reduce query time.

- ⚙️ **Efficient Processing**  
  Optimize ETL pipelines and use parallel processing where possible.

- 🏗️ **Leverage Data Warehouse Capabilities**  
  Utilize built-in features like query optimizers, workload management, and scaling options.

- 🗂️ **Indexing and Clustering**  
  Use appropriate indexing strategies and clustering keys to boost performance.

- 💾 **Caching and Materialized Views**  
  Reduce repeated computation and improve response time with caching mechanisms and precomputed views.

- 💰 **Cost Control**  
  Monitor and optimize resource usage to maintain cost-effective operations.

## 2. 🛡️ GDPR and HIPAA Compliance

- 🔍 **Identify and Classify Sensitive Data**  
  Determine what data is considered PII or PHI and classify accordingly.

- 🕶️ **Minimize Data Exposure**  
  - 🪄 Use data masking techniques  
  - 🧳 Store sensitive data only when absolutely necessary  
  - 🔐 Expose data through controlled views instead of raw tables

- 🧱 **Row and Column-Level Access Control**  
  Implement fine-grained permissions to ensure only authorized users can access specific data.

- ⏳ **Data Retention and Right to Erase**  
  Define data lifecycle policies and support user rights under GDPR (e.g., Right to be Forgotten).

- 🔐 **Encrypt Data at Rest and in Transit**  
  Ensure robust encryption standards for stored and transmitted data.

- 📚 **Documentation and Governance**  
  - 🧾 Clearly define what constitutes PII  
  - 🧑‍💼 Maintain records of who has access to sensitive data  
  - 🛡️ Establish procedures for protection and audit readiness
